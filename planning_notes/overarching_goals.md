# Updated Movie Chat Platform System Design

## 1. Current System Overview

The current system consists of:
1. A backend written in Go, using Gin for routing and PostgreSQL for data storage.
2. A frontend built with Next.js, using Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. Basic user authentication and management.
4. WebSocket-based real-time chat functionality.
5. A simple TV Guide interface for scheduled content.

### Key Components:
- User management (signup, login, logout)
- WebSocket hub for managing chat connections
- Basic room creation and management
- TV Guide with dummy data
- Chat interface for movie discussions

## 2. Areas for Improvement and Expansion

1. Authentication:
   - Transition from custom auth to Clerk for more robust authentication.

2. Real-time Functionality:
   - Enhance WebSocket implementation for better scalability.
   - Implement presence detection for active users in rooms.

3. Room Management:
   - Implement scheduling system for time-bound rooms.
   - Add categories and tags for better organization.
   - Create a trending algorithm based on user activity.

4. TV Guide Integration:
   - Replace dummy data with real movie/show data from an API (e.g., TMDB).
   - Link TV Guide entries directly to chat rooms.

5. User Experience:
   - Implement user profiles with chat history and preferences.
   - Add moderation tools for content management.

6. Backend Scalability:
   - Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   - Consider message queues for handling high volumes of chat messages.

7. Frontend Enhancements:
   - Improve responsive design for better mobile experience.
   - Implement lazy loading and virtualization for long lists (e.g., chat messages, TV Guide).

## 3. Recommended First Steps

1. Migrate to Clerk Authentication:
   - Remove existing auth code from the backend.
   - Integrate Clerk SDK into the frontend.
   - Update protected routes to use Clerk's authentication middleware.

2. Enhance Room Management:
   - Implement a scheduling system for rooms.
   - Add categories and tags to the Room model.
   - Create API endpoints for filtering rooms by category/tag.

3. Improve Real-time Functionality:
   - Refactor WebSocket implementation to handle user presence.
   - Implement a simple trending algorithm based on user count and message frequency.

4. Integrate Real Movie Data:
   - Set up an account with a movie database API (e.g., TMDB).
   - Create a service to fetch and cache movie data.
   - Update the TV Guide to use real movie data instead of dummy data.

5. Enhance User Experience:
   - Implement user profiles, including viewing history and favorite rooms.
   - Add a simple moderation system (e.g., report button for inappropriate content).

## 4. Updated System Architecture

### Backend:
- Go with Gin framework
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- Redis for caching and real-time data (e.g., user presence, trending rooms)
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- External APIs: Clerk (auth), TMDB (movie data)

### Frontend:
- Next.js with React
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clerk SDK for authentication
- Custom WebSocket client for real-time updates

### Key Models:
1. User (managed by Clerk)
2. Room:
   - ID, Name, Description, CreatorID, Category, Tags, StartTime, EndTime, IsGuideRoom, CurrentUserCount
3. Message:
   - ID, RoomID, UserID, Content, Timestamp
4. TVGuideEntry:
   - ID, MovieID, StartTime, EndTime, ChannelID

## 5. Next Phase Features
- Implement a recommendation system for rooms and movies
- Add social features (e.g., friends list, private messaging)
- Develop mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Implement advanced moderation tools (e.g., automated content filtering)
- Add support for video sharing or synchronized video playback within rooms

By focusing on these improvements and following the recommended steps, you'll be able to create a more robust, scalable, and feature-rich movie chat platform.
