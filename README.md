Hello. This repo is a WIP. 

I'm pretty happy with what I have and if you want to poke around, feel free. The Go code that I like is in the `backend` directory. The frontend is quite basic. I've maybe put two hours into it since starting the next project.

There are some files in the backend that are not used currently. They are relics of my refactor. I will delete them, but only after I'm sure I don't need the code anymore. 

This is actively developed. If you're here after considering me for a job, I'd love to talk with you about it. Messaging me on twitter is probably best.

Enjoy!
