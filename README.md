Hello. This repo is a WIP. 

I'm pretty happy with what I have and if you want to poke around, feel free. The Go code that I like is in the `backend` directory. The frontend is quite basic. I've maybe put two hours into it since starting the next project.

This is actively developed. If you're here after considering me for a job, I'd love to talk with you about it. Messaging me on twitter is probably best.

Enjoy!
